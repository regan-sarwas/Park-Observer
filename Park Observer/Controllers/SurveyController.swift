/// This class is responsible for updating state in mapView/CoreData in response to CoreLocation and user input.
/// The single source of truth is the SurveyDB, but this data is effectively duplicated in the mapView.
/// Since I can't think of a simple/efficient way for the mapView and CoreData to work together off of a
/// single datasource, I will update both in tandem through this class. To avoid surprises, this is the only class
/// that should update the entities in CoreData or the mapView's layers/markers.
/// This class should be owned by the SceneDelegate (so it can respond to life cycle events) and will provide
/// various publish properties and callbacks to other views or view controllers. This class owns the mapView, and
/// which is shared with other view controllers like the LocationButtonController.
/// It is the delegate for CoreLocation and mapView touches among others.
/// Some of its many tasks
/// - Has observable state for swiftUI views (not mapView) - i.e. on transect, current survey, current map name, ...
/// - Start/Stop trackLogging; Start/Stop observing
/// - Controls background trackLogging (do not write to UI until in foreground); consider battery usage
/// - Controls GPS point frequency; explore battery savings
